  ## Description

Using the CLI, this application helps managers view and update their company's database of employees. Using packages inquirer, mysql2, dotenv, and console.table, the interface of the application is very easily used by a business owner or manager seeking to view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role. Regardless of which CRUD operation is completed, the SQL database is updated according to the user input.
